title: Writing the Design for a Reader, and What Never to Read
impact: HIGH
impactDescription: Shared by both front doors. The design is judged by a person who hasn't read these skills, so it is written in the domain's terms with a reason for every choice; and generated or installed source is never read whole, since every line read is re-sent on every later turn.

## Writing the Design for a Human Reader

The design is read by a **human who has not read the skill files**.
They are judging the design — entities, collections, methods,
pages or tools, auth — not verifying that you followed the skill. Write
so it stands on its own.

**Don't quote skill-internal terms** when presenting the design.
They mean nothing outside this skill:

- `Shape A` / `Shape B` / `Shape C` — name the actual data
  structure: `list[Sub]` of inline sub-records, `list[str]` of
  foreign state IDs, `OrderedMap` of foreign state IDs.
- "non-state `Model`" — say "a flat sub-record that lives and
  dies with the parent" or "no identity of its own", in domain
  terms.
- `Gotcha #N` and filenames like `state-collections.md` /
  `api-pydantic.md` —
  drop the citation; if the rule matters to the design, explain
  it inline.
- `factory=True`, `Field(tag=N)`, raw pydantic spellings — fine
  to mention briefly when the spelling itself is the design
  decision, but never as the explanation.

**For every design choice, give the what + the why.** The _what_
is the concrete data structure, method type, page or tool. The _why_
is a one-clause reason rooted in the user's domain ("grows
without bound, so we need pagination"; "no methods or auth of
its own, so it lives inline"; "logged-in users only, because the
document is per-account").

**Examples.**

Collection shape — BAD:

> `documents_index_id: str` — ID of an OrderedMap actor that
> holds this user's Documents (Shape C from
> state-collections.md — unbounded).

Collection shape — GOOD:

> `documents_index_id: str` — points to an OrderedMap that
> holds this user's Documents. An OrderedMap (rather than an
> inline list) because the document collection grows without
> bound and the dashboard will paginate / sort by recency.

Nested model — BAD:

> Comment and Revision are non-state Models — Shape A.

Nested model — GOOD:

> Comment and Revision live inline on Document as
> `list[Comment]` / `list[Revision]`. They don't get their own
> state actors because they have no lifecycle, methods, or auth
> independent of the Document they belong to.

**Escape hatch.** When the precise type name _is_ what the reader
needs to see ("I'm proposing `OrderedMap` here, not `list[str]`"),
name the type — but pair it with the plain-English reason in the
same sentence. The rule is "no bare jargon", not "no technical
terms".

## Never Read Generated or Installed Source in the Main Thread

`*_rbt.py`, `*_rbt_react.ts`, `site-packages/`, `node_modules/`,
and codegen templates run to tens of thousands of lines. Every one
you open is re-sent on every remaining turn, which makes reading
them the most expensive way in the system to learn a fact.

The generated surfaces you actually need are written out in these
references: the generated client in the front door's own references
(`web-app/references/react-client.md`,
`python/references/react-generated-client.md` for an MCP UI) and the
backend shapes in `python/references/`. Use them.

If something genuinely isn't covered, bound the output hard: a
targeted `grep -n … | head -40`, or `sed -n '<start>,<end>p'` over
a known range. Never a whole generated file, never an unbounded
recursive grep.
